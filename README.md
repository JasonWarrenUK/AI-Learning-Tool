# AI Learning Tool

## Project

[FAC Coursebook Preview](https://deploy-preview-952--fac-coursebook.netlify.app/course/syllabus/developer/project-1-server/project/)

> Learners will develop an AI-driven web application that dynamically generates quizzes for users in a specified subject area. These quizzes will have interfaces both for quiz creation and quiz taking.

### User Stories

> As a learner, I want to:

- [ ] Select a subject area for my quiz.
- [ ] Begin a quiz session with randomly generated questions.
- [ ] View a summary of my quiz results, including areas of strength and weakness.
- [ ] Add, edit, and delete quiz questions and answers.
- [ ] Generate reports on quiz performance

### Acceptance Criteria 

> The application should:

- [ ] Dynamically generate quizzes with adaptive difficulty.
- [ ] Allow users to see a summary of their results after completing a quiz
- [ ] Allow users to see a summary of their results
- [ ] Provide an engaging, intuitive user interface.
- [ ] Be deployed online, accessible from various devices.
- [ ] Follow React principles and best practices
- [ ] Have automated tests for backend functionality
- [ ] Be deployed to a cloud platform
