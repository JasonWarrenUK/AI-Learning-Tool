# Project Observations

Things I noticed while working on it

## Starting Out

- Took a while to know where to start. Point the learner towards learning as a step-by-step

## Setting Up Typescript & Express

The [logrocket page](https://blog.logrocket.com/how-to-set-up-node-typescript-express/) is very good.

- The explanations of small flags in the terminal commands is a particular thing to note
- Also, it's very explicit which file we should be editing at each moment. This isn't true of some of the first few workshops in the old curriculum
- Great, I now have a working server **and** I'm pretty sure I know why I have a working server
- The links to more fully documented versions of the code are really useful
- Still finding it easy despite now having multiple new arcane dev dependencies.
