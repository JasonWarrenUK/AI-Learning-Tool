# Project Observations

Things I noticed while working on it

## Setup & Installation

- Took a while to know where to start. Point the learner towards learning as a step-by-step

### Resource: Setting Up Typescript & Express

The [logrocket page](https://blog.logrocket.com/how-to-set-up-node-typescript-express/) is very good.

- The explanations of small flags in the terminal commands is a particular thing to note
- Also, it's very explicit which file we should be editing at each moment. This isn't true of some of the first few workshops in the old curriculum
- Great, I now have a working server **and** I'm pretty sure I know why I have a working server
- The links to more fully documented versions of the code are really useful
- Still finding it easy despite now having multiple new arcane dev dependencies.

### Resource: What is a Web Server

- First time I've understood the difference between a static and dynamic web server

## Writing an API

### Resource: Node fs and Express

Lol, link doesn't work so I found some other resources on building an API. They're here in case that's helpful.

### Resource Hunt: REST APIs

#### Shelved

- [Medium Article 4](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/api-server-setup-with-express-js-mongodb-and-typescript-part-1-bea7e4f5b526)
  - Fine so far, though the setup contradicts some of what we did earlier so you have to be confident enough to not just type everything he does
  - Part 3 pivots to MongoDB so I'm gonna leave it for now

#### GET IN THE SEA

- [~~Postman Blog~~](https://blog.postman.com/how-to-create-a-rest-api-with-node-js-and-express/)
  - Good clear explanation of what a REST API is and what methods they use
  - Ugh I think this might make me clone their repo in order to do this. I'll see how far I get
  - Oh bollocks this is all vanilla JS, fuck this
- [~~Medium Article 1~~](https://medium.com/@siddharthmakadiya/building-a-sample-api-using-node-js-and-express-d7d8f66fb419)
  - Vanilla JS only
- [~~Medium Article 2~~](https://wahyu-ehs.medium.com/rest-api-with-express-js-and-typescript-f702840e3e98)
  - Writer isn't a native English speaker, probably fine but not great for uncertain learners
- [~~Medium Article 3~~](https://blog.bitsrc.io/understanding-a-restful-api-using-node-js-and-typescript-6f9cede6b579)
  - Just not feeling it and don't have all day
- [~~Medium Article 5~~](https://codewithantonio.medium.com/build-your-rest-api-with-node-express-typescript-mongodb-2ceb8970adf1)
  - It's a video, which can fucking do one
