# Project Observations

Things I noticed while working on it

- Took a while to know where to start. Point the learner towards learning as a step-by-step
- The logrocket link is very good.
  - The explanations of small flags in the terminal commands is a particular thing to note
  - Also, it's very explicit which file we should be editing at each moment. This isn't true of some of the first few workshops in the old curriculum
  - Great, I now have a working server **and** I'm pretty sure I know why I have a working server
  -
