# Project Observations

Things I noticed while working on it

## Setup & Installation

- Took a while to know where to start. Point the learner towards learning as a step-by-step

### Resource: Setting Up Typescript & Express

The [logrocket page](https://blog.logrocket.com/how-to-set-up-node-typescript-express/) is very good.

- The explanations of small flags in the terminal commands is a particular thing to note
- Also, it's very explicit which file we should be editing at each moment. This isn't true of some of the first few workshops in the old curriculum
- Great, I now have a working server **and** I'm pretty sure I know why I have a working server
- The links to more fully documented versions of the code are really useful
- Still finding it easy despite now having multiple new arcane dev dependencies.

### Resource: What is a Web Server

- First time I've understood the difference between a static and dynamic web server

## Writing an API

### Resource: Node fs and Express

Lol, link doesn't work so I found some other resources on building an API. They're here in case that's helpful.
